# aurelia-typescript-basics
Very (very very) basic configuration for aurelia with typescript.

Assuming you have npm and jspm installed.

Run from the directory where you have cloned this repo:

```
$ jspm install
```

Then you can use for example http-server node package to act as your server or use server of your choosing.
